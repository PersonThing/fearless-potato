# Slide Prompts

These are now the 13 static slides loaded automatically on startup. After the static deck, Ctrl+K opens the command bar for interactive AI-generated slides.

## Static Deck

1. Title slide: "The Fearless Potato"
2. The skeptic phase
3. Learning to steer — scaffolding
4. Handing over more
5. The lightbulb: give it the problem, not the plan
6. Rapid prototyping and creative solutioning
7. Pay attention to what goes wrong
8. Teaching and side projects with my kids
9. The TRS-80 and Minecraft-in-C++ story
10. How this app works under the hood
11. The tool-use loop source code
12. The ask
13. Closing slide

## Interactive Phase (Ctrl+K)

After the static slides, open the command bar and ask the AI anything:

- "Show me the CommandBar component source code"
- "How does the inline markup parser work?"
- "What RAG tools does this app have?"
- "Show me the system prompt"
